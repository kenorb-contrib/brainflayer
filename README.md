Brainflayer
===========

Brainflayer is a Proof-of-Concept brainwallet cracking tool that uses
[libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1) for pubkey generation.
It was released as part of my DEFCON talk about cracking brainwallets
[(slides)](https://rya.nc/dc23).

The name is a reference to [Mind Flayers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illithid),
a race of monsters from the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. They eat
brains, psionically enslave people and look like lovecraftian horrors.

Usage
-----

Precompute the bloom filter:

`hex2blf example.hex example.blf`

Run Brainflayer against it:

`brainflayer example.blf < phraselist.txt`

or

`your_generator | brainflayer example.blf`

Should compile on Linux with `make` provided you have the required devel libs
installed (at least openssl and gpm are required along with libsecp256k1's
build dependencies).

Better readme soon. :-P
